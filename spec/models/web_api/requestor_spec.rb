# I couldn't get this spec to work- I think there may be a bug with Webmock that returns an empty response body. A bit strange.
# What I would do here (if time to investigate and resolve the issue) is stub out the next_race api responses and test how my code behaves.
# From my proding of the URL, it only ever returns 200 ok and 404 Not Found (with a blank JSON body), so I would stub out these scenarios
# first and then throw in a few other scenarios, such as 500 Internal error etc to insure my code can handle whatever the API throws at it.
